# Workflow Emulator

This project demonstrates the power of VSKI Durable Workflows running directly
in the browser. Using a high-fidelity in-memory emulator, you can explore
complex distributed system patterns, human-in-the-loop approvals, and
fault-tolerant logic with zero infrastructure requirements.
