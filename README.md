- [x] 🛡️ [Coverage Report](https://emulator.vski.ai/coverage/index.html)

This project demonstrates the power of VSKI Durable Workflows running directly
in the browser. Using live api or a high-fidelity in-memory emulator, you can
explore complex distributed system patterns, human-in-the-loop approvals, and
fault-tolerant logic with zero infrastructure requirements.
